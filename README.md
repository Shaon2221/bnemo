# bn-emo
A database for translating emoji, emoticons into Bengali relevant phrases for NLP tasks.

## Background
Normally text corpus or text data contains different type of emoji, emoticons to express emotions and sentiment, specially text collected from social media. But this emojis have hardly any meaning in terms of text analysis if those are not converted into text. From that observation, we are trying to build a database of translation for common emoji, emoticons in Bengali so that Bengali NLP practitionars can use this database to translate emoji, emoticons into Bengali pharases for better understanding text.
